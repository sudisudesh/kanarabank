              The origins of State Bank of India date back to 1806 when the Bank of Calcutta (later called the Bank of
              Bengal) was established. In 1921, the Bank of Bengal and two other Presidency banks (Bank of Madras and
              Bank of Bombay) were amalgamated to form the Imperial Bank of India . In 1955, the controlling interest in
            the Imperial Bank of India was acquired by the Reserve Bank of India and the State Bank of India (KANARA)
              came into existence by an act of Parliament as successor to the Imperial Bank of India . In the Indian
              Financial world, KANARA is synonymous with trust and security.
              In line with recognized International Practice and for the information of customers and others who visit
              the Bank's website we believe it is necessary to post a privacy statement. The information shared with the
              Bank will be treated as private. We also desire to say explicitly that adequate precautions have been
              taken to protect information relating to customers and their dealings with the Bank from the mischievous
              and the fraudsters.
